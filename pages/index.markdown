@template helpBooksIndex.html

[NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) is a free and open source RSS reader for Mac and iOS.

So far we’ve got just one help book.

**[NetNewsWire 5 for Mac Help Book](mac/5.0/en/)** (English)

A “Help Book” is really just a small website. We call them that because it’s the traditional name for Mac app manuals.

When we add more help books, we’ll link to them here. NetNewsWire 5 for iOS will have its own separate help book, for instance.
