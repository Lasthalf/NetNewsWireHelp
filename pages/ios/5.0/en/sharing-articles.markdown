When you’re reading an interesting article, you may feel compelled to share it with a friend, to your blog, or to a social media account. Tap on the Share button when you’re viewing an article:

<img src="../../../images/ios-en-share_button.png"
     alt="A screenshot of NetNewsWire’s toolbar, calling out the Share button."
     class="centeredImage"
     style="width: 60%;" />

The destination for the article is up to you: where you’re sharing it to, and to whom.

Almost every app supports sharing features, where it makes sense. Try it out and you’ll probably save yourself some time compared to copying and pasting.


Sharing to Micro.blog
---------------------

You may want to share what you’ve read – and your thoughts – even wider.

We love [Micro.blog][m.b], a social network built on open web technologies. (Like RSS!)

With the [Micro.blog app][m.b-app], it’s even easier to share and publish your thoughts. The Micro.blog app will start a new post with a Markdown link, ready for you to share.

What if my app isn’t in the Share menu?
---------------------------------------

When the share panel opens, you may not find the app you’re looking for. Here are some things to try:

- *Listed Off-screen:* Scroll across the app icons. Your app may be listed after some other, more commonly-used ones.
- *Hidden:* The app you’re looking for may be tucked away in the *More* menu. Scroll to the end of the app icons and then tap on *More* and look for your app there.
- *Actions:* Some apps use actions to accept shared items. Scroll *down* the Share panel and look for things to do with your app.

If you still can’t find it, the app you want to use may not accept shared items – at least not in a way that NetNewsWire can send it.

The one option that should always work, no matter the app is to tap on *Copy*, and paste the URL into the destination app.
