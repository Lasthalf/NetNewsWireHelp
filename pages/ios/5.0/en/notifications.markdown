# Be notified of new articles

<span class="badge-warning">iOS and iPadOS Only</span>

NetNewsWire for iOS and iPadOS can notify you when it gets new articles for your favorite feeds.

This feature works for individual feeds, so you don’t have to turn it on for everything – just those you want to see first.

To get notifications for a feed:

1. From the feed list, **touch and hold on the feed**
2. Choose **Get Info**
3. Turn on **Notify About New Articles**
4. Tap **Done**


## How quickly will I be notified?

You will be notified when NetNewsWire downloads the article. When this happens depends on how frequently NetNewsWire is set to refresh feeds, and when the last refresh was completed.

If you want notifications sooner, Feedbin make [*Feedbin Notifier*][fbn], a notification app for use with their service. It will probably notify you sooner than NetNewsWire can do.
