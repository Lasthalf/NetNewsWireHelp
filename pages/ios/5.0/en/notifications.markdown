This feature works for individual feeds, so you don’t have to turn it on for everything – just those you want to know about first.

Turn on notifications for a feed
--------------------------------

1. From the Feeds screen, **touch and hold on the feed**
2. Choose **Get Info** from the contextual menu
3. Turn on **Notify About New Articles**
4. Tap **Done**


Turn off notifications
----------------------

If you no longer want to be notified of a feed’s new entries, you can turn *off* **Notify About New Articles** in the feed’s settings, using the steps above.

This must be done for each feed. If you don’t want any notifications *at all*, you can turn off notifications in *System Settings*.


How quickly will I be notified?
-------------------------------

You are notified when NetNewsWire downloads the article. iOS suggests the best times for NetNewsWire to check for new articles based on when you often open the app.

If you want notifications sooner, Feedbin make [*Feedbin Notifier*][fbn], a notification app for use with their service. It notifies you as soon as Feedbin knows about a new item.
