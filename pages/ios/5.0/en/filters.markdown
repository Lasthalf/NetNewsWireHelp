@title Using timeline filtering
@template nnw5ios_en.html

NetNewsWire can automatically filter and hide feeds and articles that you have already read.

Use the **Filter** button in the title bar.

You can filter in two locations: the Feeds screen, and in an article list – the timeline.

Turning on the read filter in the Feeds list hides any feeds with no unread items. This way you can skim the list and find any feeds that you want to read first.

Using the read filter on the timeline hides articles that you’ve read before. This is especially helpful when you’ve only selectively read articles in the list, or if you missed an item farther down the timeline.
