@title Renaming feeds and folders
@template nnw5ios_en.html

The feeds you subscribe to publish a title for their site or feed. This is usually the name of the site or the author. Other feed titles may be unusually or unhelpfully long. Or, worst case, the title is completely wrong.

On the other hand, you may want to remember a site by something other than its title: *Indian Recipes* rather than *Manjula’s Kitchen*.

To get around these situations, NetNewsWire allows you to ignore the site’s title and use your own. You can change the title when you add the feed, or any time later.


Set a feed name when adding
---------------------------

Your first opportunity to rename a feed comes when you add it to NetNewsWire. Before you tap **Add**, you can enter your own name and disregard any title given in the feed. Bon appétit !


Changing a feed’s name any time
-------------------------------

You can edit a feed or folder’s name any time using the feed info screen.

From the Feeds screen, **touch and hold on the feed** then choose **Get Info**. Tap on the feed name to begin editing it.

<span class="badge-note-small">Tip</span> When viewing a feed’s articles in the timeline, you can tap on the feed name in the title bar to access the feed info screen.
