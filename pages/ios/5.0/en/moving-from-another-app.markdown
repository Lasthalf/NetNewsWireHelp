There are lots of great feed readers. Fortunately, it’s easy to switch amongst them to find the perfect one for you.

NetNewsWire is no different: coming is just as easy as [going](export-opml). Though we hope NetNewsWire is right up your street.



If you use a feed fetching and syncing service
----------------------------------------------

You can use your Feedbin or Feedly account directly in NetNewsWire. [Add your account](syncing-accounts) to get started.

Other syncing services aren’t supported yet, but you can still use a local account – see below.

Moving from one app to another is usually a breeze.

Subscription lists are commonly shared using the OPML format. It’s just text (XML), easily readable by software – and even by humans, if they wanted.

In your current app, look for the export feature. It might be in the app’s settings. In Reeder, for example, go to Settings, tap on the account and then tap on *Export as OPML…*.

It’s easiest to save the OPML file to a location in the Files app – on your device or to a cloud account like iCloud or Dropbox.

After you’ve saved the file, open NetNewsWire and follow the instructions to [import the OPML file](import-opml). We hope you enjoy using NetNewsWire.
