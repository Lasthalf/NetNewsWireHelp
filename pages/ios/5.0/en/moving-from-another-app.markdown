There are lots of great feed readers. Fortunately, it’s easy to switch amongst them to find the perfect one for you.

NetNewsWire is no different: coming is just as easy as [going](export-opml). Though we hope NetNewsWire is right up your street.

How to move your subscriptions between apps depends on how you check for new articles, and whether you use a feed fetching service.



If you use a feed fetching and syncing service
----------------------------------------------

If you use Feedbin or Feedly, it’s simple to read your feeds in NetNewsWire. *Just [add your account](syncing-accounts)!*

Other syncing services aren’t supported yet, but you can still use a local account – see below.



If you don’t use a feed fetching and syncing service

RSS embraces what’s wonderful about the web: *openness*. By extension, RSS apps tend to be open as well.

This means that moving from one app to another is usually a breeze.

Subscription lists are usually shared using the OPML format. It’s just text (XML), easily readable by software – and even by humans, if you wanted.

In your current app, look for an Export function. It might be in the app’s settings. In Reeder, for example, go to Settings, tap on the account and then tap on *Export as OPML…*.

It’s easiest to save the OPML file to a location in the Files app. Choose a place to save the file – on your device or a cloud account like iCloud or Dropbox.

Now open NetNewsWire and follow the instructions to [import the OPML file](import-opml). We hope you enjoy using NetNewsWire!
