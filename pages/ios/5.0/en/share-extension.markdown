@title Using the Share Extension to add feeds
@template nnw5ios_en.html

NetNewsWire provides a Share Extension which allows you to subscribe to a site’s feed easily from within other apps.


Where to find the Share Extension
---------------------------------

Just look for the Share icon – for example, in the Safari toolbar:

<img src="../../../images/ios-en-safari_share_menu_icon.png"
     alt="A screenshot of Safari’s toolbar with the Share icon circled."
     class="centeredImage"
     style="width: 60%;" />

Tap on the Share icon and from the Share menu, look for the NetNewsWire icon.

<img src="../../../images/ios-en-system_share_menu.png"
     alt="A screenshot of the iOS share sheet with the NetNewsWire icon visible."
     class="centeredImage"
     style="width: 50%;" />
     
<span class="badge-warning-small">Note</span> You may need to scroll across the app list and tap **More** to find it.


Tap on the NetNewsWire icon. In the resulting screen you have the opportunity to rename the feed and choose the folder where it will be saved. If you’ve got more than one account, each is represented as a folder, in addition to any folders within an account.

<img src="../../../images/ios-en-system_share_menu_add.png"
     alt="A screenshot of the add feed dialog in the iOS share sheet."
     class="centeredImage"
     style="width: 50%;" />

When everything is set, tap **Add Feed**.

NetNewsWire will then look at the web page, locate its feed address and add it to your subscription list. The next time you open NetNewsWire, your new feed will be there.



### If the Share Extension isn’t able to locate a feed

Some sites may not have a feed available, or it may not specify the feed address in the commonly-accepted way. In either case, NetNewsWire won’t be able to add the feed automatically.

You may be able to find a link to a feed by checking the site. There, look for a link to an RSS, Atom or JSON feed. If one exists, you can copy the address and [add it to NetNewsWire directly](adding-feeds).

If you can’t find a feed at all, you may consider writing to the web site author or administrator, and request they add one.
