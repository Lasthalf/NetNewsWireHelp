[The NetNewsWire Privacy Policy](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/privacypolicy)

NetNewsWire has a very strict privacy policy – we don’t want any private information about you.

The only data we get about how you use NetNewsWire is crash logs – and that’s *only if you agree and opt in*. On iOS and iPadOS these logs are provided to us by Apple’s *Analytics & Improvements* facility.

To opt out of sharing crash logs
--------------------------------

To change whether crash reports are shared from your device, use the **Settings** app and choose **Privacy › Analytics & Improvements** and turn off **Share With App Developers**. 

<span class="badge-small">Note</span> This disables sharing crash logs for *all* non-Apple apps on your device.


Changes to the Privacy Policy
-----------------------------

The [full privacy policy](https://github.com/brentsimmons/NetNewsWire/blob/master/Technotes/privacypolicy.markdown) is stored in the NetNewsWire GitHub repository, where you can track any changes we might make.
