@title How to export feeds with OPML
@template nnw5ios_en.html

Your subscription list is portable, meaning you can easily switch to another app or service at any time. You can save a file containing all your NetNewsWire subscriptions.

This file is saved in the OPML format. It’s a widely supported *open* format that’s effectively the standard for sharing feed subscription lists.

Export your feeds
-----------------

On iPhone and iPad, you can export a subscription list and save it to a location in the Files app.

<span class="badge-small">Note</span> Your subscriptions will be unaffected by exporting them – nothing is changed or removed.

1. From the Feeds screen, tap the **Settings** button

     style="width: 60%;" />
2. In the *Feeds* section, tap **Export Subscriptions**
3. If you have multiple accounts, choose which account’s subscriptions will be exported
4. Choose the location to save the file

You can use the exported file with any app or service that allows you to import OPML-formatted subscription lists.
