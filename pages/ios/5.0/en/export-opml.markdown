@title How to export feeds with OPML
@template nnw5ios_en.html

Your subscription list is portable, meaning you can easily switch to another app or service at any time. NetNewsWire can save a file containing all your subscriptions.

This file is saved in the OPML format. It’s a widely supported *open* format that’s effectively the standard for sharing feed subscription lists.

On iPhone and iPad, you can export a subscription list and save it to a location in the Files app.

**Note:** Your subscriptions in NetNewsWire are unaffected by this action. Nothing is changed or removed.

1. From the Feeds screen, tap the **Settings** icon

2. Scroll to the *Feeds* section and choose **Export Subscriptions**
3. If you have multiple accounts, choose which account’s subscriptions will be exported
4. Choose the location to save file

You can use this file for any app or service which allows you to import OPML-formatted subscription lists.
