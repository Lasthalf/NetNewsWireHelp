TestFlight builds
-----------------

NetNewsWire will have a public TestFlight program once weâ€™re ready to start publishing betas. Soon.

<!--
If you want to help test new features, or just want to be at the bleeding edge, you can join the TestFlight program for NetNewsWire.

**If you use test builds, please note:** Test builds may have bugs. You may lose data. NetNewsWire may crash.

You can report bugs and enhancement requests by filing issues on the [NetNewsWire GitHub page][nnw-issues]. You can also share and discuss issues on the [NetNewsWire Slack][slack] group.
