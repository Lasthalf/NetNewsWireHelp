@title How to read articles in NetNewsWire
@template nnw5ios_en.html

NetNewsWire is designed to make reading fast, easy and natural.



Read with Next Unread
---------------------

The *Next Unread* button helps you move effortlessly between articles and feeds.

     alt="A screenshot of NetNewsWire’s toolbar with the ‘Next Unread’ button circled and labelled."
     class="centeredImage lightBorder"
     style="width: 60%;" />

No matter where you are, tapping it will take you to the *next unread* item. It doesn’t matter if it’s in another feed, it just opens it straightaway.

This is a great way to zip through your articles, stopping to read what you’re interested in.



Use Reader View to always see the full article
----------------------------------------------

Some web sites only publish extracts of their full articles. Reader View will try to fetch the full article text for you so you can keep reading in NetNewsWire. It can even get images.

You can turn Reader View on for any article by tapping its button in the toolbar.

     alt="Two screenshots, with the left showing a summary article and the right the full article extracted using Reader View."
     class="centeredImage"
     style="width: 80%;" />

Now there’s no reason to interrupt your reading by visiting the site.

<span class="badge-small">Note</span> Reader View may not be able to process some sites. It will try its best, but if anything looks wrong, it’s best to visit the site.



Read in full-screen mode
------------------------

Sometimes you may want to fully immerse yourself into an article. Use full-screen mode to remove distractions as you read.

### Full-screen mode on iPhone

Turn on **Read in Full Screen** in Settings.

<!--

     style="width: 70%;" />
-->

You can also turn on full-screen mode while viewing an article by tapping at the top of the screen. Tap again to turn it off.


### Full-screen mode on iPad

Tap the Full Screen button in the navigation bar to turn on full-screen mode on iPad.

     style="width: 80%;" />

When you’re finished, tap the back button to see the timeline again.




Read using a keyboard
---------------------

When using your iOS device with a keyboard connected, you can navigate using the **space bar**, just like with the macOS version of NetNewsWire.

If you’re reading an article that can be scrolled, pressing space bar will scroll it – like in Safari and other apps. When you get to the end of the article, pressing the space bar will take you to the next unread.
