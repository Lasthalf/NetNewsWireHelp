@title How to read articles in NetNewsWire
@template nnw5ios_en.html

NetNewsWire is designed to make reading fast, easy and natural. Any time you’re reading there’s one useful button: **Next Unread**

<img src="../../../images/ios-en-next_unread.png"
     alt="A screenshot of NetNewsWire’s toolbar with the ‘Next Unread’ button circled and labelled."
     class="centeredImage shadowedBox"
     style="width: 60%;" />

No matter where you are, tapping it will take you to the *next unread* item. It doesn’t matter if it’s in another feed, it just opens it straightaway.

This is a great way to zip through your articles, stopping to read what you’re interested in.

Reader View
-----------

Some web sites only publish extracts of their full articles. Reader View will try to fetch the full article text for you so you can keep reading in NetNewsWire. It can even get images.

You can turn Reader View on for any article by tapping its icon in the toolbar.

<img src="../../../images/ios-en-reader_view_before_after.png"
     alt="Two screenshots, with the left showing a summary article and the right the full article extracted using Reader View."
     class="centeredImage"
     style="width: 90%;" />

Now there’s no reason to interrupt your reading by visiting the site.

<span class="badge-warning-small">Note</span> Reader View may not be able to parse some sites. It will try its best, but if anything looks wrong, it’s best to visit the site.


Using an External Keyboard
--------------------------

When using your iOS device with a keyboard connected, you can navigate using the **space bar**, just like on the macOS version of NetNewsWire.

If you’re reading an article that can be scrolled, pressing **space bar** will scroll it – just like it would in Safari. If you’re at the end of the article, pressing **space bar** will take you to the next unread article.

<span class="badge-note-small">Tip</span> There are lots more useful [keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts) to use when you’ve got a keyboard connected to your device.
