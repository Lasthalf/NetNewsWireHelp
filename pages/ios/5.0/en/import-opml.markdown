@title How to import feeds from other apps with OPML
@template nnw5ios_en.html

You can use an OPML subscription list to import your subscriptions from another app or service into NetNewsWire.


Get an OPML file
----------------

You will get the OPML file from your current app or service. Look for the export feature. It might be in the settings screen. On an iOS or iPadOS device, save the `.opml` file to a location in the Files app. From a Mac, save the file to iCloud drive or other syncing service connected to your device.



Import the feeds
----------------

Once you’ve got the OPML file saved, NetNewsWire can make quick work of importing the items within.

1. From the Feeds screen, tap the **Settings** button

     style="width: 60%;" />
2. Tap **Import Subscriptions**
3. If you have multiple accounts, choose which account will receive the new subscriptions
4. Tap on the OPML file from its location in the Files app

Once you’ve finished importing the feed list, you can delete the downloaded `.opml` file. If you need a copy later, you can [export your OPML subscription list](export-opml) from NetNewsWire.
