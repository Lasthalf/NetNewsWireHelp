@title How to import feeds from other apps with OPML
@template nnw5ios_en.html

You can use an OPML subscription list to import your subscriptions from another app or service into NetNewsWire.

First you need to get an OPML file. This should be pretty easy – look for export options in the app or the service’s web site. Save the `.opml` file to a location in the Files app.

Once you’ve got the OPML file saved, NetNewsWire can make quick work of importing the items within.

1. From the Feeds screen, tap the **Settings** icon

     class="centeredImage shadowedBox listImage"
     style="width: 60%;">
2. Tap **Import Subscriptions**
3. If you have multiple accounts, choose which account will receive the new subscriptions
4. Tap on the OPML file from its location in the Files app

The subscriptions are added to your Feeds list immediately.

**Note:** *This won’t replace your current subscription list.* The new subscriptions will be added to your current list of feeds.

Once you’ve finished importing the feed list, you can safely delete the downloaded `.opml` file. If you need a copy later, you can also [export your OPML subscription list](export-opml) from NetNewsWire.
