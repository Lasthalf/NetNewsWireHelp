@title Using syncing accounts with NetNewsWire
@template nnw5mac_en.html

NetNewsWire can sync your feeds and articles with third-party feed aggregating services like Feedbin and Feedly.

Using these services lets you use multiple apps across different platforms, but keep a single subscription list. Article status is also tracked, so your unread and starred articles stay in sync too.

If you‚Äôre not using a feed aggregator, you can use NetNewsWire in local account mode with an [On My Mac account](on-my-mac).
