@title Installing and using the Safari Extension to add feeds

NetNewsWire provides a Safari Extension which adds a *Subscribe to Feed* button to your Safari toolbar. With it, you can quickly add a site’s feed without entering an address manually into NetNewsWire.


Installing the NetNewsWire Safari Extension
-------------------------------------------

The Safari Extension is installed automatically with NetNewsWire. However, it must be enabled before you can use it.

1. Open Safari
2. From the menu bar, choose **Safari** and then **Preferences…** (⌘,)
3. Click the **Extensions** panel in the Preferences window
4. From the list, select **Subscribe to Feed** to enable the extension
5. Close the Preferences window

     class="centeredImage"
     style="width: 80%;" />

Once this is done, the *Subscribe to Feed* button will be added to your Safari toolbar.

Adding a feed using the Safari Extension
----------------------------------------

For any site that advertises its feeds, you can use the *Subscribe to Feed* button. Clicking it sends the feed’s address to NetNewsWire where you can set options like an alternative feed name, and the account and folder where it will be saved.


### If the *Subscribe to Feed* button isn’t working

The *Subscribe to Feed* button will only be enabled for sites that advertise a feed in their code. If the button is greyed out and disabled, it wasn’t able to find any feeds automatically.

You may be able to find a link to a feed by checking the site. There, look for a link to an RSS, Atom or JSON feed. If one exists, you can [add this URL to NetNewsWire directly](adding-feeds). Control-click on the link and copy the URL to paste into NetNewsWire.
