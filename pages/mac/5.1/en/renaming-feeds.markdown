@title Renaming feeds and folders
@template nnw5mac_en.html

The feeds you subscribe to publish a title for their site or feed. This is usually the name of the site or the author. Other feed titles may be unusually or unhelpfully long. Or, worst case, the title is completely wrong.

On the other hand, you may want to remember a site by something other than its title: *Indian Recipes* rather than *Manjula’s Kitchen*.

To get around these situations, NetNewsWire allows you to ignore the site’s title and use your own. You can change the title when you add the feed, or any time later.


When adding a feed
------------------

Your first opportunity to rename a feed comes when you add it to NetNewsWire. Unless you added it through [Safari](safari-extension), you might not know the feed’s published title yet. Regardless, before you click **Add**, you can enter your own name for it. Bon appétit !


Editing titles after adding a feed or folder
--------------------------------------------

You can edit a feed or folder’s name any time using the *Rename* command or by using the Inspector.

## Renaming using the contextual menu item

1. Control-click on the feed or folder in the sidebar
2. Choose **Rename** and enter the new name

## Renaming using the Inspector

1. Select the feed or folder in the sidebar
2. Choose **Window › Info** from the menu bar
3. Enter the new name and press **Return**
