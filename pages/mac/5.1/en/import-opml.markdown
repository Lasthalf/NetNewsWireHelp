@title How to import OPML
@template nnw5mac_en.html

You can use an OPML subscription list to import your subscriptions from another app or service into NetNewsWire.

First you need to get an OPML file. This should be pretty easy – look for export options in the app or the service’s web site.

Once you’ve got the OPML file, NetNewsWire can make quick work of importing the items within.

1. From the menu bar, choose **File › Import Subscriptions…**
2. If you have multiple accounts, select which account will receive the new subscriptions
3. Navigate to the OPML file’s location
4. Select it and click **Open**

*This won’t replace your current subscription list.* The new subscriptions will be added to your current list of feeds.

Once you’ve finished importing the feed list, you can safely delete the downloaded `.opml` file. If you need a copy later, you can also [export your OPML subscription list](export-opml) from NetNewsWire.
