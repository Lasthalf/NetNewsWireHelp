@title Using syncing accounts with NetNewsWire
@template nnw5mac_en.html

In addition to the [On My Mac account](on-my-mac), NetNewsWire can also sync your feeds and articles with third-party feed aggregating services.

Using a feed aggregator service allows you to use multiple apps across different platforms, but keep a single subscription list. The service handles fetching articles and keeping track of read status for you.

**Note:** In NetNewsWire 5.0, [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) is the only sync service supported. Additional services will be supported in future 5.x releases.
