Hide the unread badge in Dock
-----------------------------

NetNewsWire shows a red badge on its icon whenever you’ve got unread items. If you usually read all your new items (or mark them as read!), the badge lets you know that new articles have arrived. Exciting!

However, if you leave unread items between visits to NetNewsWire, the badge can become distracting, less meaningful, or even stressful. You may find that turning it off is helpful.

Choose **NetNewsWire** → **Preferences** and uncheck **Show unread count**.

Nonetheless, we advocate liberal use of *Mark as Read* — you don’t have to read everything!
