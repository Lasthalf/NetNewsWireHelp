@title Contributing


NetNewsWire is open-source and contributions from the community are welcomed.

There are two channels for contributing. There is a Slack group for conducting discussions. For filing tickets, and contributing code or documentation, we use GitHub.

Every community member is expected to abide by the code of conduct included in the [NetNewsWire Contributing][contrib] page.


Slack
-----

[Join the Slack group][slack] to talk with other NetNewsWire users – and to help out, if you’d like to, by testing, coding, writing, providing feedback, or just helping us think things through. Everybody is welcome and encouraged to join.


GitHub
------

The [NetNewsWire project on GitHub][nnw-git] is the place to raise formal issues like bugs and feature requests. If you want to make contributions to NetNewsWire’s code or documentation, please refer to our [contribution guidelines][contrib] page on GitHub.
