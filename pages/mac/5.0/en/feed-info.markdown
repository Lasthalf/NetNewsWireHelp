@title How to get and copy feed information


Sometimes you’re subscribed to a feed you really want to share with a friend. The quickest way to get the feed URL or the site URL is to copy them from NetNewsWire.

1. Control-click the desired feed in the sidebar
2. Choose **Copy Feed URL** to get the direct feed address (`http://www.alphabettes.org/feed/`) or **Copy Home Page URL** for the site’s address (`http://www.alphabettes.org/`)
