@title Sorting the NetNewsWire timeline
@template nnw5mac_en.html

The NetNewsWire timeline is the list of articles shown in the centre pane.

     alt="A screenshot of the NetNewsWire window calling out the timeline in the middle of the window."
     class="centeredImage"
     width="90%" />

By default, this list displays newer articles at the top.

You can change the sorting for the timeline in the View menu: choose **View → Sort by → Newest Article on Top** or **Oldest Article on Top**.

This setting applies to all feeds and can be changed anytime.
