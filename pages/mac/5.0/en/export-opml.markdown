Your subscription list is portable, meaning you can easily switch to another app or service at any time. NetNewsWire can save a file containing all your subscriptions.

This file is saved in the OPML format. It’s a widely supported *open* format that’s effectively the standard for sharing feed subscription lists.

1. From the menu bar, choose **File** → **Export Subscriptions…**
2. If you have multiple accounts, select which account’s subscriptions will be exported
3. Choose the name and location for the OPML file
4. Click **Export OPML**

Your subscriptions in NetNewsWire are unaffected by this action. Nothing is changed or removed.

You can use this file for any app or service which allows you to import OPML-formatted subscription lists.
